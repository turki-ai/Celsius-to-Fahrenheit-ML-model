# Celsius-to-Fahrenheit-ML-model
a simple machine learning model that learn how to convert a Celsius to Fahrenheit **without giving it the equation**.
the model is developed using tensorflow keras on a tiny dataset of 4 samples of input and output, and eventually discovers the linear relationship by itself.
the project is purely educational, nothing big.
